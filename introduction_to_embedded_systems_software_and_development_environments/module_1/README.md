# Module 1 – Embedded Systems Development Components

This folder contains my work for **Module 1** of the *Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments* course offered by the University of Colorado Boulder.

## Module Summary

In this module, I was introduced to the main components of the embedded systems software development process. It provided an overview of key foundational concepts that will be explored in greater depth in future modules.

Topics covered include:

- Hardware and software building blocks of embedded systems  
- Refresher on essential C programming concepts  
- Development tools and environments  
- Git version control and source configuration management  
- Installation and use of a Linux virtual machine (VM)

At the end of the module, I completed a simple C programming assignment using the VM and Git to manage the project.

## Learning Achievements

As part of this module, I was able to:

- Identify the components of an embedded system  
- Understand and apply Source Configuration Management (SCM) principles  
- Use Git to manage a software project with multiple commits  
- Write a basic C program that calculates and prints statistics (min, max, mean, median)  
- Compile and run C code using GCC from the command line  
- Create and maintain a version-controlled codebase for embedded development
